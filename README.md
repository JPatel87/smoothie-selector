# Smoothie Selector

Smoothie Selector is an interactive command line program which aims to help users decide on which smoothie to make. It is targeting users who are interested in making smoothies based on their nutritional value. The program iterates through a series of questions in order to narrow the smoothie choice selection down for the user based on their responses. 

# UX

## Site Owner Goals

The objectives of the site owner are: 
* To create a user friendly, attractive, command line program that is easier to follow.
* To create a program that is useful for target users.
* To create a program to that is of industry standard.

## User Stories

User would like:

* To be able to open up the program and immediately be able to grasp what its purpose is.
* The program is clean and consistent in layout.
* The program is easier to follow through.
* The program asks relevant questions to help narrow down smoothie recipes that I can choose from.

# Features

## Existing Features

* Title 
    * The title is enclosed between two fruit emoji's either side of it. The purpose of this is to add colour and a fun aspect to the command line and make the program appealing. 
    * The emoji external python library has been used here.

* Questions and Inputs
    * The question and input prompts have been styled with colour, consistently throughout the program. This is so that users are clearly able to see where their input is required.
    * Both appear in yellow font.
    * The question print statements are additionally highlighted on a red background, to distinguish it from the input prompt.

## Acknowledgements

This project has been an eye-opening experience for me to develop a command line program that looks appealing and is able to manipulate data to deliver results. My thanks goes to Code Institute tutor support who have been fantastic at answering all my queries and my tutor, Seun Owonikoko, for her insight and guidance.
