* Title 
    * The title is enclosed between two fruit emoji's either side of it. The purpose of this is to add colour and a fun aspect to the command line and make the program appealing. 
    * The emoji external python library has been used here.

* Questions and Inputs
    * The question and input prompts have been styled with colour, consistently throughout the program. This is so that users are clearly able to see where their input is required.
    * Both appear in yellow font.
    * The question print statements are additionally highlighted on a red background, to distinguish it from the input prompt.
